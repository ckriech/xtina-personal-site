20:50,PST,19-11-2022,[games, opinions],turns out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1224290/Horizons_Gate/">horizon's gate</a>is actualy good. I thought it was mostly proc-gen like the dev's last game, but I don't think it is. neat!
20:53,PST,19.11-2022,[games, opinions],I have nothing against proc-gen tbh, I love the shit out of many roguelikes. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/415920/Voidspire_Tactics/">Voidspire Tactics</a>, Rad Codex's first game, was short and the design was really tight and I loved it.
20:57,PST,19-11-2022,[games, opinions],their second game though, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/643900/Alvora_Tactics/">Alvora Tactics</a> was mostly proc-gen dungeons and it lacked a lot of the polish and interesting puzzles from the first game, at least in the amount I played before I stopped.
21:00,PST,19-11-2022,[games, opinions],i think proc-gen game content is great is many cases, but I think it needs to be pretty tight to outshine just a really thoughtful hand-made dungeon, especially in a psuedo-jrpg. 
21:07,PST,19-11-2022,[games, opinions],also I am loving my steam deck. god I almost dislike how much I am enjoying it. It's been great for all the travel I've been doing
21:08,PST,19-11-2022,[unmasking-autism,self-stigma],one non-games thought. <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/688819/unmasking-autism-by-devon-price-phd/">Unmasking Autism</a> is *excepional* and the target audience is way later than one might think, so defintely check it out. I've been thinking about Dr. Price wrote about self-stigma and how much that affects someone's self-image.
21:12,PST,19-11-2022,[unmasking-autism,self-stigma], Tbh, I've worked though some self-stigma around being transfem and neurodiverse, but I'm still coming accross my own stigma against myself as a chroniclaly-ill person and as a white person/colonizer/oppressor. The latter has been on my brain today. Being white and a colonizer ...shouldn't be something I hate about myself, as much as I want to. I can't change what's led to this moment and I can't change my former behavior, but I can use the privledge and power that's implcitcly given to people of my race/class and advocate for better shit and learn and not just tell myself how awful I am. Shame/guilt don't fix problems. If I go and try to help and fuck up, rad. I'd rather try and fuck up and learn than continue to not do shit.
21:17,PST,19-11-2022,[unmasking-austism,self-stigma],boy is that hard to balance against being ill and watching my spoons/energy envelope sometimes. Sometimes not doing shit is the right move, as aggrevating as that is. Someone told me recently that 'that doesn't sound like living' and fuck that ablest kind of thinking. Just living with EDS,POTS,CFS,etc is so exhausting. The amount of work and attention it requires is unreal and I don't know if people who aren't dealing with their own disabilities really understand that.
