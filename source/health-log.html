    	<p>This truly shouldn't be public info, but I'm tired of using apps from corporations to track my health info.</p>
    	<p>Putting it online for like 10 people total to see instead of how ever many would take my info and do shit with it feels a little better to me honestly</p>
    	<p>I'm saying this without having read any of the privacy or data agreements I've made with apps like MigraineBuddy, maybe they are legit, I don't know</p>
    	<p>I do know that I'm far more likely to use something custom thing I made instead of whatever form I'd get from a mass-produced app, because it's *mine*<p>
    	<p>And I can do what I want with my own data. So let's start</p>

    			Summary: Woke up headache-y and migrainey, first time in awhile. I didn't sleep amazingly, I haven't since being in this airbnb for a week. 
    			The blankets are too warm for me, I'm not comfrtable. I also smoked weed for the first time in a bit yesterday, that could have something to do with it.
    			I also went for way too fast of a walk yesterday (note to self, don't angry walk), and I am wondering if I overdid it after that.
    			I took a migraine pill first thing this morning and had a decent amount of caffeine, but nothing has worked yet honestly.
    			Weirdly, besdies the migraine and feeling fatigued in general, I feel pretty good? Maybe it's because feeling sick is freeing.
    			It's hard to be anxious when I have to deal with my immediate symptoms. I can relax and chill for once. Even though hypothetically I'm relaxing and chillin all the time, that's not what it feels like.
    			In fact, it feels like I'm stressed out and depressed most of the time.
    			Creating stuff yesterday felt super good. And I didn't feel like I stretched myself with that too much either, actually.
    			I didn't shoot way above my skill level for once and just did the absolute minimum, which is grand honestly.
    			I think this is just a public journal entry I guess? So be it.
