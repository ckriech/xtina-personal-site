    Sick Day</br>
    </br>
    Someday I will have to (take a look at) the fact</br>
    That I like being sick</br>
    </br>
    I don’t want to die</br>
    (the majority of the time)</br>
    And I still want to carry on with my life</br>
    But I wish I was sick</br>
    </br>
    Why would anyone want to be sick?</br>
    I am sick, now, probably have been.</br>
    But that’s maybe not what it’s about.</br>
    </br>
    I want to be sick</br>
    But not *too* sick</br>
    Sick enough to be contagious</br>
    But fine otherwise</br>
    Like a mild infectious skin rash</br>
    Or a timid flu</br>
    </br>
    I wish I was sick</br>
    There’s no humor, good or bad, that I’m sick now</br>
    That’s not where I go with this</br>
    I could say </br>
    “I wanted it to bad, now I have it”</br>
    But that’s not what I am trying to say</br>
    </br>
    When I wish I was sick</br>
    All those times I didn’t feel well</br>
    That I didn’t want to work</br>
    Felt too tired</br>
    Or too burnt out</br>
    or didn’t want to go to class today</br>
    or —</br>
    </br>
    Those days were my most peaceful</br>
    I could relax.</br>
    If I wasn’t sick,</br>
    Then I should be doing something</br>
    And not having a diagnosis means I’m not sick</br>
    Therefore all of these feelings are me just not being “good enough”</br>
    “trying hard enough”</br>
    “caring enough”</br>
    They aren’t my body telling me to show down</br>
    because it can’t handle this pace</br>
    day after day</br>
    work work work tired work tired work tired tired work burnout burnout burnout</br> burnout burnout</br>
    </br>
    (different poem?) </br>
    </br>
    You know what you should be doing on your disability leave?</br>
    working</br>
    work work work work</br>
    that core inside of you always wanting</br>
    desiring</br>
    not desiring </br>
    feeling</br>
    finding</br>
    never finding </br>
    happiness or relaxation or purpose</br>
    just keep doing tasks, cross them off your list</br>
    so you can relax.</br>
    </br>
    you say you are lazy</br>
    that you never do anything </br>
    Have you considered maybe not actually doing anything?</br>
    Oh no, it’s the voice </br>
    the one that holds me back</br>
    no silly, that’s not my purpose</br>
    Listening to yourself isn’t holding you back</br>
    it’s seeking clarity from the bowels of your own existence </br>
    the finding peace within yourself</br>
    it’s figuring out it’s been there all along</br>
    you just have to </br>
    stop looking (for it) </br>
