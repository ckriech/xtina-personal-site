    [2021-08-06 (best guess at least)]</br>
    </br>
    I've got this feeling running down my back</br>
    I just keep going until I crack</br>
    I can't write for shit but I keep trying</br>
    Can you help me please doctor I'm pretty sure I'm dying</br>
    </br>
    I wake up everyday with a head</br>
    that feels like it's been emptied with a trowel</br>
    what does a bitch need to do</br>
    to wake up and feel not like shit for once</br>
    </br>
    I have to keep my adrenline underwraps </br>
    because if I don't my whole being unravels</br>
    chest tight, heart beating so fast that it stops</br>
    Just keep me going until I drop</br>
    </br>
    this is poetry its a first draft</br>
    of something I'll never release because it's daft</br>
    my rhymes are increblicle just like the rest of me</br>
    so please can a doctor just fucking perscribe me</br>
    </br>
    spend everyday imagaing what it would be like to work</br>
    like I don't want to do that but a dumb bitch needs to be paid</br>
    I'm forming something here right now that has no substance</br>
    I keep trying until they just doesn't</br>
    </br>
    my ears ring so loud its a siren</br>
    calling my brain back into my skull</br>
    I can't keep doing this fucking dance and song</br>
    I can't keep rhyming when I can't hear the words</br>
    over the droning and echoing and tight check and </br>
    drips of sliava and blood down my back</br></br>
    there's nothing keeping me here, I'm here by choice</br>
    people think that I'm looking for sympathy when I'm just trying to relate</br>
    </br>
    I'm not some broken bitch who just came out the closet</br>
    I'm a queen bitch who just doesn't have it</br>
    Stop with your explaining everyone one of my problems</br>
    I don't care if you are queer you don't know whats up with </br>
    </br>
    Just ask the muslims<sup>[1]</sup>, it doesn't matter if you are queer</br>
    keep the fuck out of BIPOC people's spaces</br>
    and maybe don't ignore their posts in the chat</br>
    to go make a quick to your dumb fuck white (clapback)?</br>
    </br>
    Maybe just expand past the periphery where youve been eterally</br>
    just gay enough to care but not queer enough to act</br>
    we're all just broken shells of a never-proud people</br>
    we have no past and we just think that's the deal</br>
    </br>
    I got off the escalator a long time ago </br>
    and I'll never go back because it's not the way home</br>
    I left that dumb bitch back in the PNW</br>
    with the rest of the racist bitches and your imagined sense of </br>
    </br>
    I'm not the hero of this story, I'm the fucking killer</br>
    I'm the antagoist and the monster in the thriller</br>
    I'm the dread that creeps up your back</br>
    When you ignore our fates (I'll just keep writing this track?)</br>
    </br>
    I'm the monster with the foot long pussy</br>
    you can still perform cunnalingus you'll just choke on my clit</br>
    sit the fuck down with your falsified real power</br>
    and be crushed under 200 pounds of this hot motherfucker</br>
    </br>
    I choose</br>
    what I do</br>
    everyday</br>
    everyday</br>
    </br>
    I choose what I do</br>
    eveyrday</br>
    everyday</br>
    </br>
    I choose</br>
    what I </br>
    do </br>
    </br>
    everyday</br>
    </br>
    everyday</br>
    </br>
    I chooooooooooose what</br>
    </br>
    </br>
    I do</br>
    </br>
    everyday</br>
    </br>
    </br>
    </br>
    </br>
    everyday</br>
    </br>
