    what if I decide jus to not to back</br>
    </br>
    what happens if I decide</br>
    to not go back to my old haunt?</br>
    if i just let it drop away</br>
    they aren’t fighting for me by proxy</br>
    so why do I fight so hard to stay?</br>
    </br>
    </br>
    —what happens now when I don’t have a </br>
    way to make money anyway</br>
    I guess I just starve and die alone</br>
    or I find a place that care about more than </br>
    just what words I can sling —</br>
    </br>
    if i shall die before i wake</br>
    o pray the lord the heart will take</br>
    </br>
    hey </br>
    hello</br>
    i have a question</br>
    okay, shoot</br>
    well, um, what if </br>
    what if I just don’t go back?</br>
    well, i don’t know, what happens?</br>
    i should feel terrified but i’m not</br>
    really I just feel free</br>
    i have so many obligation still</br>
    i could afford to live here cheap if I could make it</br>
    i’m not terrified to lose my way</br>
    i’m not scared to throw it away</br>
    i’m not here to be allowed to grow old</br>
    i’m here to be allowed to burn it to regrow</br>
    i don’t know why i’m here or why the nutrients made me so</br>
    why my body twists and turns and can’t stand on its own</br>
    why i smash my arm three times</br>
