    my current thesis for everything</br>
    </br>
    healing takes place over a long period of time. People want you to be rush, they want to know when you will be ready
    to be back. You may feel it some days, yes I am ready to go back! Then the next day, you get a reminder of how long
    you've been healing. Not over the last few weeks, over the months, years, decades, the lifetime of your
    experiences.</br>
    </br>
    Relationships don't take place over days, they take place over a long time. Hurts from early attachment aren't
    magically healed by explanation.</br>
    </br>
    This isn't my point.</br>
    </br>
    My point is that healing is a slow burning heat. You get pieces here and there and they slowly come together to make
    a whole. Some day,</br>
    </br>
    Relationships take place over long distances of time.</br>
    </br>
    The same with the earth. She's persistent and has survived a lot. We've survived with her. This digit won't be won
    today, it may not be in our live times. Don't worry today about what you can't do right now, focus on healing your
    wounds, inner 9outer and spiritual, and create bonds that will break the grasp of whatever I'm done</br>
