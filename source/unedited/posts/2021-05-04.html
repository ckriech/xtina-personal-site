    </br>
    I’m again at the brink</br>
    Life spread out below me</br>
    Like the rivers spreading when you look down form a mountain top</br>
    It’s an original metaphor, I know</br>
    Rivers</br>
    Human Condition</br>
    </br>
    I’m again at the brink. </br>
    I’ve done all I *need* to do</br>
    I’ve done everything urgent </br>
    That’s left me with nothing</br>
    and everything</br>
    </br>
    Today I *practiced*</br>
    and *created*</br>
    and had fun</br>
    </br>
    Yesterday was fire and burning</br>
    Today was chill</br>
    I’m okay being here where I am</br>
    </br>
    But I am still on the brink</br>
    </br>
    I used to worry that I would never change </br>
    I would be the same, forever, until I was dead</br>
    Now I know change is slow</br>
    Efforts take years, decades, generations </br>
    Change is slow and insidious </br>
    You chip away</br>
    10 mins here, 10 mins there</br>
    One thing at a time </br>
    You stop trying</br>
    Because underneath of all that trying </br>
    Is fear</br></br>
    </br>
    Youtube recommendations videos will inform you of the thing you are missing from making your life ‘successful’</br>
    Propaganda straight to your ears</br>
    You just haven’t learned the trick yet </br>
    There’s an easy path, you just have to find it</br>
    At the end of the path of finding the path</br>
    There’s just, yet again, another path</br>
    More choices</br>
    More anxiety </br>
    More fear</br>
    More uncertainty </br>
    More death</br>
    </br>
    Maybe I don’t have a self. Maybe I’m the matter that becomes the human</br>
    Maybe I am the constant hum in my ears</br>
    </br>
    I must *do* constantly</br>
    I just always need to help moving</br>
    Or Else</br>
    I get the whispers </br>
    </br>
    Yesterday I punched myself 4 times in the arm and twice in the thigh while standing in the kitchen at 11:00 am</br>
