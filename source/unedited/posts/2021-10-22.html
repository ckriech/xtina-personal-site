    [10/22/21]</br>
    </br>
    our words have twists and turns</br>
    but they still carry the message</br>
    the one that stays says you'll be next in my head</br>
    and keeps me from kicking the bucket</br>
    your sweet charms lidded by smart smarm</br>
    keep me going when my own inner self runs dry</br>
    I sometimes forget to see my own future</br>
    over the random thought of the morning</br>
    keep me going and keep me moving</br>
    myself has to do the real work</br>
    but havinf you there to say your piece</br>
    helps a bit helps a lot keeps the peace</br>
