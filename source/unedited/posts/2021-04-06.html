    problem: I want to build this cat shelf</br>
    </br>
    what’s stopping me:</br>
    </br>
    1. worried about using my brain too much and hurting it</br>
    2. spending energy I don’t have on going to the hardware store</br>
    3. asking [roommate] for yet another favor (use his tools)</br>
    4. I am scared about being judged for being a femme lad buying wood and not knowing what they are doing</br>
    5. That the idea is entirely impulsive</br>
    6. That I should spend time working on the garden instead, which will be a huge task, and I can do the cat shelf
    later</br>
