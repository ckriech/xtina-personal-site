    </br>
    I look at the bruise on my arm</br>
    everyday</br>
    more than once</br>
    It’s got .....layers</br>
    light purple on the side towards my wrist</br>
    maybe the point of most impact </br>
    spreads down in an oval, maybe 2 inches long</br>
    I can see a vein protrude through the center of it</br>
    closer to my elbow </br>
    there’s a clear division </br>
    where it turns brown and green</br>
    a little wider maybe</br>
    and go towards the right</br>
    back into the oval</br>
    a clear spot, </br>
    it’s almost hard to see</br>
    it looks like a trick of the light if you look too long</br>
    but it’s there</br>
    </br>
    these are my markings </br>
    i’m like a gothy teen, or whatbI thought one would be like</br>
    I punched myself in the arm, 4 times</br>
    and twice in the thigh</br>
    standing in my kitchen</br>
    it wasn’t a moment that changed me</br>
    there was no bright clarity </br>
    I felt a little better, for a moment </br>
    </br>
    I don’t know what this means</br>
    or why I did it</br>
    there’s no sign to find </br>
    no hidden motive </br>
    i struck my arm 4 times</br>
    and my thigh twice</br>
    </br>
    reading online about self-harm makes it sounds like I should be ashamed on it, that the shame of it makes it hard to
    talk about </br>
    maybe if I was 15</br>
    but I’m not</br>
    I’m me</br>
    I’ve seen a lot</br>
    Punched quite a few things </br>
    mostly inantinate objects </br>
    </br>
    I’m me</br>
    I punched myself 4 times in the arm</br>
    I took my right hard, curled it into a ball, and quickly thrust my knuckles into the left forearm</br>
    where everyone could see it</br>
    I didn’t know if it would leave a mark</br>
    that wasn’t really the point</br>
    or at least it didn’t go through my head</br>
    </br>
    this is probably the worst I’ve hurt myself</br>
