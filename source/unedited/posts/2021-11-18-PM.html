    [11/18/21, kind of sung to the tune of "working for the knife" by Mitski. Written just before I started this
    project]</br>
    </br>
    Sometimes I forget</br>
    why I'm here</br>
    why I don't</br>
    wanna belong</br>
    </br>
    sometimes I remember</br>
    that I think I'm in</br>
    not in the void</br>
    not in the void anymore</br>
    </br>
    sometimes I think that there's nothing left for me</br>
    when you are done with it</br>
    sometimes I think that I was meant to create</br>
    but just look at me</br>
    try to belong</br>
    </br>
    I take in, I profess, I anger and I address</br>
    I feel kindly coldly fondly and smoothly and at the end</br>
    there's nothing left</br>
    there's nothing left</br>
    </br>
    keep feeling feeling keeping feeling feeling keeping feel keep on and on and on and on</br>
    </br>
    and on</br>
    and on</br>
    and on</br>
</body>
