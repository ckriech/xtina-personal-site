    Hi! This is christina from [recent Halloween party]. Hello! Would you be interested in meeting up for coffee
    sometime? I would like to get to know you better, in a professional capacity. I’m planning to be around
    [organization] more as it gets safer to do so in-person and I’m really curious about you and what being on the board
    is like and what being a person using she/they pronouns in that world is working out and etc. </br>
    </br>
    Also, I just want to reiterate that I respect an understated yet on point costume and, personally, I think yours was
    great in tha</br>
