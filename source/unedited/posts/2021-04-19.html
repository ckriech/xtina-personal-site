    my sweet sweet brain</br>
    </br>
    what are we stressing out about today?</br>
    the uncertainty of my leave?</br>
    my job?</br>
    the future?</br>
    america?</br>
    the earth?</br>
    my social life?</br>
    my family?</br>
    what people think about when i miss an obligation?</br>
    my partners?</br>
    getting a migraine?</br>
    dying?</br>
    living well?</br>
    not ever feeling like I am enough?</br>
    </br>
    do I just fold the insides until they don’t hurt anymore?</br>
    I do tasks and tasks and tasks and </br>
    mark each one off</br>
    it’s never enough </br>
    to keep it at bay</br>
    the end of my world</br>
    the start of my day</br>
    i don’t know where</br>
    well ever goooooo</br>
    but when you see</br>
    me please say helllooooo</br>
    </br>
    do I bend the insides until they meet the outsides</br>
    do I just keep self-regulating?</br>
    until the end of the daaaaaaaaay</br>
    </br>
    Hey self</br>
    it’s self-regulation hour </br>
    I feel well for a day</br>
    For each person murdered</br>
    For each trans person killed</br>
    For each mentally ill person shot</br>
    For each Black child choked </br>
    </br>
    </br>
    i have to live </br>
    and i hate it</br>
    i wish there was no more of me</br>
    and that it could finally end</br>
    i want to share my day with you</br>
    because i can’t do it on my own</br>
    i can’t keep distracting myself</br>
    with task and task and task</br>
    it will never end</br>
    i can’t keep the demons at bay with progress</br>
    only clensing </br>
    and trusting </br>
    and sitting in the discomfort </br>
    remembering that it’s the clothes I wear</br>
    when I go outside </br>
    it wraps me up and keeps my life delivering surprise after surprise</br>
    frustration </br>
    annoyance</br>
    out of breath</br>
