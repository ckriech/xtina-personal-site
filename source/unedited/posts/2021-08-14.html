    </br>
    I said</br>
    </br>
    I said I want to produce</br>
    I want to make ....things</br>
    I want to reifiy my ideas</br>
    into machines</br>
    I want to</br>
    build a concept</br>
    from the depths</br>
    of my subconscious</br>
    I want to share</br>
    my dumb little ideas</br>
    with the lovely little people</br>
    who are in my life</br>
    I want to inspire</br>
    I often want to die</br>
    but I won't</br>
    at least, not on purpose,</br>
    because I haven't created enough yet</br>
    will someone look through my phone after I'm gone lol</br>
    and read all of my bad poems?</br>
    Because</br>
    if this is it</br>
    and no one ever reads it</br>
    what was the point?</br>
    does making something no one will see mater?</br>
    does playing games for entertainment matter?</br>
    does any of this matter?</br>
    why do we do anything?</br>
    I didn't mean for this to get extensional</br>
    it's just that</br>
    I kind of don't get it</br>
    boyfriend dungeon said love yourself for your current you (basically)</br>
    I think I do (I don't)</br>
    I am scared to be alone</br>
    because I don't want to face</br>
    my deep down core connection</br>
    I'm 5 months out of work</br>
    I'm used to it by now</br>
    and this is how I'd like things to e</br>
    I don't want anyone to bother me</br>
    I want to play games and masterbate</br>
    until I fade into antiquity</br>
    </br>
    I want to make things</br>
    I want to take ny ideas and put them down with my shakey hand</br>
    onto this piece of paper --</br>
    or digitial text --</br>
    </br>
    I want to make things</br>
    I want to die slowly</br>
    I don't want to die</br>
    I want to live to live, not live to die</br>
    or die to die</br>
    or die to live</br>
    live to live. life for life. death for death.</br>
    my head alwas hurts</br>
    and my brain constantly buzzes</br>
    and doctors don't believe me</br>
    i was tod I can do the things I want because I am genuine and kind</br>
    I wish other peoples words could really make a foothold</br>
    in my deepest of deep pits</br>
    but they just don't</br>
    unfortunely</br>
    </br>
    reframe</br>
    </br>
    I take the kind works people I respect have told me</br>
    and embellish my dark twisted teenage goth insides</br>
    my sadness and woe and torment and loneliness</br>
    I want to be judged and left</br>
    [alone?]</br>
